# V. Anton Paul defines problem solving in programming as:
    # “Problem solving is writing an original program that performs a particular set of tasks and meets all stated constraints.” - Think Like a Programmer


# Understand the Problem - english.

# Plan
    # Don't jump into coding just yet its time to plan out how you're going to solve it first.
    #
    # Some of the questions you should answer at this part of the process:
        # Does your program have a user interface? what will it look like? what   functionality will the interface have? sketch this out on paper
        # What inputs will your program have? will the user enter data or will you get    input from somewhere else
        # What’s the desired output?
        # Given your inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output?

    # Pseudo Code

# Divide and Conquer
